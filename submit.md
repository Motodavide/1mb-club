## Review & Accepting Submissions

**All websites submitted will be manually reviewed for honesty and quality assurance.**

1MB Club has the final say whether a website is added to the official listing or not. Spam, low-quality pages, or shady SEO gimmicks will be ignored. If your website is not accepted, please do not take it personally. Let's refrain from being rude to each other!

**The two rules for a web page to qualify as a member:**

<ol>
    <li>Total website size (not <i>just</i> transferred data) must not exceed 1 megabyte</li>
    <li>The website must contain a reasonable amount of content / usefulness in order to be added - no sites with a simple line of text, etc.</li>
</ol>

## How to Submit

I'm trying my best to make the site submission process as painless as possible. The goal is to avoid spam while trying not to exclude as many "non-techies" as possible.

There are currently two options to submit:

1. Forking the [Github project repo](https://github.com/bradleytaunt/1mb-club), adding your site file and opening a PR
2. E-mail (see below)


### Option 1: Github

Option #1 is the preferred preference. Your website will be reviewed much faster and editing any minor mistakes is a more seamless process.

That said, I am fully aware that not everyone is familiar with Github, and others would prefer to avoid the site altogether. That's understandable.

If you would prefer to use e-mail over Github pull requests, then keep reading.

### Option 2: Email (sourcehut)

Option #2 is less ideal but still fine. Your submission will take longer to review and any changes required might become more of a pain to fix. Please use **plain text** when emailing.

When sending an email for submission please provide:

1. The URL
2. The link to your [Pingdom results](https://tools.pingdom.com)

Thank you.
